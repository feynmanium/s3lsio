# S3lsio
AWS S3 command line utility written in rust. Works with both V2 and V4 signatures. This is important when working
with third party systems that implement an S3 interface like Ceph. Ceph Hammer and below use V2 while Jewel and higher
use V4.

WIP - Heavy development so there could be many breaking changes...
